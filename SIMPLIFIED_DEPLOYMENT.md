# Simplified Replit Deployment Server

This is a purpose-built, ultra-lightweight production server designed specifically for deploying single-page applications (SPAs) on Replit.

## Why This Solution Works

Our application previously had deployment issues due to:

1. Conflicts between development and production environments
2. Path mismatches between Vite's build output and Express's static file serving
3. Port conflicts with WebSockets and development servers

The `replit-deployment-server.js` solves these issues by:

1. Using a minimal Express server with only essential components
2. Properly serving static files from the `/dist/public` directory
3. Using the Replit-provided PORT environment variable
4. Including proper SPA fallback routing to index.html
5. Removing all API routes and WebSockets that could cause conflicts

## Deployment Configuration

For Replit deployment, set:

**Build Command:**
```
npm ci && npm run build
```

**Run Command:**
```
node replit-deployment-server.js
```

## Server Features

- Security with Helmet middleware
- Performance with Compression middleware
- Proper static file caching
- ETag support for client-side caching
- Production-ready error handling
- Health check endpoint
- SPA routing support

## Understanding the Code

The server is intentionally minimal, focused solely on serving the built Vite application. It:

1. Sets up Express with security and performance middleware
2. Configures static file serving from the correct directory
3. Adds a fallback route to serve index.html for all SPA routes
4. Listens on the port provided by Replit

This purpose-built approach is more reliable than trying to adapt a complex development server for production use.
