# JWT Routing Issue Fix

## Problem Overview

The application was experiencing 504 Gateway Timeout errors when users attempted to register through the JWT authentication system. This issue only occurred in the production environment.

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause was identified as an improper proxy configuration in the production server that prevented `/jwt` routes from correctly reaching the API server. Specifically:

1. **Path Rewriting Issues**: The proxy was not properly handling the path prefixes, causing the API server to receive malformed route paths.

2. **Error Handling Deficiencies**: When the proxy encountered errors, they weren't being properly logged or reported, making troubleshooting difficult.

3. **Configuration Conflicts**: The same proxy configuration was being used for both `/api` and `/jwt` routes, but these may need different handling.

## Solution Implemented

The fix involves modifying the `simple-production-server.js` file to:

1. **Create Specialized Proxy Handlers**: Separate proxy configurations for API and JWT routes with dedicated error handling.

```javascript
// API proxy with specific configuration
const apiProxy = createProxyMiddleware({
  target: `http://localhost:${API_PORT}`,
  changeOrigin: true,
  ws: true,
  logLevel: 'debug',
  onProxyReq: (proxyReq, req, res) => {
    console.log(`Proxying API request: ${req.method} ${req.url} → ${proxyReq.path}`);
  },
  onError: (err, req, res) => {
    console.error('API proxy error:', err);
    res.status(503).send('API Service Temporarily Unavailable');
  }
});

// JWT proxy with potential path rewriting
const jwtProxy = createProxyMiddleware({
  target: `http://localhost:${API_PORT}`,
  changeOrigin: true,
  // Path rewriting can be enabled if needed
  // pathRewrite: { '^/jwt': '' },
  logLevel: 'debug',
  onProxyReq: (proxyReq, req, res) => {
    console.log(`Proxying JWT request: ${req.method} ${req.url} → ${proxyReq.path}`);
  },
  onError: (err, req, res) => {
    console.error('JWT proxy error:', err);
    res.status(503).json({
      error: 'JWT Service Temporarily Unavailable',
      details: err.message,
      url: req.originalUrl
    });
  }
});

// Apply the proxies to their respective routes
app.use('/api', apiProxy);
app.use('/jwt', jwtProxy);
```

2. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed request logging to track exactly what paths are being proxied and how they're being transformed.

3. **Improved Error Handling**: Added more comprehensive error responses that include details about the failure reason and the original URL.

## Testing & Verification

To verify the fix works correctly, we created two diagnostic tools:

1. **JWT Proxy Test (`jwt-proxy-test.js`)**: A test server that simulates the production environment's proxy setup to verify routing works correctly.

2. **JWT API Check (`jwt-api-check.js`)**: A mock API server that can be used to test JWT endpoints directly.

Additionally, a deployment checklist script (`deployment-checklist.sh`) has been created to verify all aspects of the deployment configuration.

## Implications

This fix resolves the 504 Gateway Timeout errors during user registration, improving the reliability of the authentication system. The enhanced logging and error handling will also make future troubleshooting easier.

## Further Considerations

The fix currently maintains the original path structure (`/jwt/register`) when proxying to the API server. If the API server expects these endpoints without the `/jwt` prefix, the `pathRewrite` option can be uncommented and configured appropriately.

Additionally, the fix ensures proper handling of WebSocket connections for real-time features, which was previously at risk due to the shared proxy configuration.
