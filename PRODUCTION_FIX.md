# Production Fix for FaAxis Site

## The Problem

The production site is showing a "Loading application..." screen that never completes loading.

## Emergency Solution

We've created several options to fix this issue, in order of simplicity:

### Option 1: Super Simple Emergency Server (Guaranteed to Work)

This approach serves a completely static HTML version of the homepage with working testimonial carousel:

1. Deploy the application
2. In the run command field, enter: `npm run emergency`

This will run the super-simple-server.js which serves a static HTML file for the homepage. The testimonials will scroll automatically every 3 seconds.

### Option 2: Simple Server (Likely to Work)

This approach tries to serve the actual React application but with more fallbacks:

1. Deploy the application
2. In the run command field, enter: `npm run simple`

### Option 3: Normal Server (Original Approach)

1. Deploy the application
2. In the run command field, enter: `npm start`

## How to Switch Between Options

If one approach doesn't work, you can simply redeploy and change the run command to try a different option.

## What Each Option Does

- **Option 1 (emergency)**: Serves a completely static HTML page with no dependencies. Guaranteed to display correctly.
- **Option 2 (simple)**: Tries to serve the React app with simplified paths.
- **Option 3 (normal)**: Uses the normal application server.

## Admin Access

For all options, admin access is still available at `/admin-login`.
