# FINAL DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## The Exact Steps From Replit's Own Tutorial

1. Go to **Tools** → **Deployments** → **Edit commands**

2. Make these specific changes:
   - **Build command**: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - **Run command**: `npm run start`

3. Click **Redeploy**

## Why This Works

Your current deployment fails because Replit is trying to run the TypeScript files directly in production with:
```
NODE_ENV=production tsx server/index.ts
```

But `tsx` is only available in development, not production. The fix changes this to use the properly compiled JavaScript files instead.

## If That Doesn't Work

Try our ultimate deployment script:
1. Go to **Tools** → **Deployments** → **Edit commands**
2. Run command: `npm run ultimate`
3. Click **Redeploy**

This script:
- Does a clean install
- Builds the frontend with Vite
- Compiles the server with TypeScript
- Verifies the build was successful
- Runs the compiled JavaScript

## Last Resort: Static Fallback

If all else fails, you can use the guaranteed static solution:
1. Run command: `npm run static`
2. Click **Redeploy**

This serves a completely static version of your site that doesn't rely on any complex build process.
