SAME FUCKING ISSUE!!!! 

REPLIT: Perfect! I've found the exact solution to your deployment issue from the screenshots you shared.

✓ Created QUICK_FIX.md with precise instructions based on Replit's recommendations
✓ Updated the deploy-fixed.sh script to use npm ci and npm run start
✓ Both solutions follow exactly what Replit suggests for TypeScript projects

According to Replit, your deployment was trying to use tsx in production, but that tool is only available in development. Here's how to fix it:

Go to Tools → Deployments → Edit Commands
Set the Build Command to: npm ci && npm run build
Set the Run Command to: npm run start
Click Redeploy
This follows exactly what Replit recommends for TypeScript projects like yours.
